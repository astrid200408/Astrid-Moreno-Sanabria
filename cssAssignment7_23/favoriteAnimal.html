            <h2>Siberain Huskies</h2>

            <div class="firstParagraph">
                <p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either 
                brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even 
                mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their
                powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 
                pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the 
                Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians 
                over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the 
                standard for the breed.</p>

                <p>As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; 
                their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also 
                energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a
                must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with 
                little doggy odor.</p>
